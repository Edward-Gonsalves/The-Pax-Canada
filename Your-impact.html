        <p class = "intro-para">The Pax Canada is a project that was made for school project, however it's 
            meant to show people how these kind of public-private partnerships are advertised to the general
            public and other groups interested in these partnerships. These projects are funded by both
            public and private organisations meaning these projects are influenced by the organizations completeting 
            the contracts, trade unions for the workers who will work on these projects, the investors and Governments
            which fund these projects and the public who will ultimately be the main beneficiaries of these projects.
        </p>
        <p class = "intro-para">This means that everyone can influence projects like this, including you. 
            These projects are often Government funded and always need Government approval from at
            all levels of government, from federal to municipal, which means that the people who those
            governments are responsible to have power over these projects. This means that if a government is proposing a project that you
            don't like make your concerns known to the relevant authorities such as writing to your federal
            representatives or your municipal council. If you are part of a union that represents workers who
            will build these projects then you should contact your union leader. But overall you should make
            your voice heard. It's your tax dollars that are being spent on these projects and as you saw in
            the finance page even though that's ficitious finance plan it's based on the average expense 
            for similar projects you should check online because Governments and Corporations make 
            website like this to pitch their ideas.
