        <p class = "sub-para">As a project that is being both publicly and privately funded it's very
            important that people know the source of the money. The project is estimated to
            cost 85 billion dollars, though run overs are to be expected. The majority of the funding
            as can be seen in the graph to left comes from the Government with Canadian Government 
            paying 70 billions dollars. This is spilt between the 30 billion from the Federal Gouvernment
            and 20 billion each from both the Ontario and Quebec provincial governments. The remaing 15 billion
            will come from corporations that are set to benefit from this project such as the Orlando Corporation.
            These corporations often support projets like this when they can benefit from them in the future
            or if they want to develop Canada in general.
