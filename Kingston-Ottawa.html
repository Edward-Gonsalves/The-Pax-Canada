        <p class = "intro-para">This section of the Pax Canada will connect two of Canada's most
            important cities, namely Kingston and Ottawa further linking these cities to
            Canada's other major urban areas located on Lake Ontario and areas farther west. 
        </p>
        <p class = "sub-para">This line will cross a distance of around 147 km which will mostly
            be straight, due to the fact that terrain in this area facilitates it to be more straight
            and with the terrain being relatively flat will make the line more efficient. Like the other
            lines, this one will be electric making the line more enviornmentally friendly and put the
            early infrastructure in place for it to be made a high speed line in the future when the demand
            for it materializes.
