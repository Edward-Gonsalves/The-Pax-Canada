        <p class = "intro-para">This line will connect two of Canada's most important urban centers, the 
            capital city of Ottawa and the second largest city in Canada, Montreal. This line would be 155 km
            and also require a bridge over the Saint Lawerence River. An additional bridge would be built
            instead of using excisting bridges in order to allow for the excisting lines to still be used 
            for their intended purposes while this new bridge can just serve the Pax Canada.
        </p>
        <p class = "intro-para">This section of the project would receive the most investement due to
            the fact that these are some of the most important cities in Canada and this part of the line will become very 
            important in connecting Canada's Eastern Maritime Provinces with those in the West.
