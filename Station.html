        <p class = "intro-para">The Pax Canada project mainly focuses on connecting the cities on the route.
            In order to travel within cities, people will need to use other method of transportation. 
            Once you are on the Pax Canada you can stay on the train if you would like to go the next 
            city you don't need to go to a different station though in some cases you may need to us
            a different train.
        </p>
        <p class = "intro-para">Each city will have new stations built in order to connect the new Pax
            Canada lines even better and allow other stations to continue to maintain existing lines and
            also switch to more cargo based transportation over time. In particular, the Hamilton and Toronto
            stations will need to be different due to the fact they are Maglev lines instead of being regular
            lines. These stations will of course be built up to all safety stantards and to be as accessible to
            the general public as possible.
