        <p class = "intro-para">The line between Toronto-Kingston would be brand new electrified line
            which would lead to continued urbanization in The Greater Toronto Area. This project would make
            Canada's railways more effecient and enviormentally friendly and will enable Canada to begin to wane
            itself off our dependence on oil.

        <p class = "intro-para">These additions to the current railway infrastructure that currently connects Toronto to Kingston would greatly improve
            infrastructure in the region and connect up Canada's rural areas to our major urban centers. It would
            also help us in providing electricity to these rural areas since we could transmit electricity over
            the same wires that power the trainline. This would lay the early infrastructure requited for Maglev 
            rail to be used in area later on if their is demand for it.

        <p class = "intro-para">When planning the route we made sure it goes around any historical sites and important enviormental 
            features in order to decrease the cost of construction and eliminate any potential damage to these sites. Though for the most part we tried to
            keep the line straight in order to limit cost of construction and to facilitate efficient use of the line.
