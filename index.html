        <p class = "intro-para">The Pax Canada Railway is a proposed Railway project that would revolutionize
            travel between Canada's major metropolitan areas! People will be able to travel from Toronto 
            to Quebec City much faster than ever before. This project will use new technologies 
            that are revolutionizing the railway industry. The name Pax Canada comes from the Latin
            word for peace which is Pax and the term is often associated with times of peace and prosperity
            such as when the term is used in Pax Britannica and Pax Mongolica. With the name implying that
            this project will bring even prosperity to large portion of Canada, with the direct translation of
            Pax Canada being Piece of Canada.
